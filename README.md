# Project Documentation: Employee Management System

## Introduction
This document outlines the functionality of the Employee Management System, developed using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and Angular. It follows best practices in software development and utilizes a modular architecture.

## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application that allows CRUD operations for employee records. It also features an image slider on the homepage to enhance the user interface.

## Functionality

### Key Features
1. **Employee Management**: Users can create, edit, view, and delete employee records. Each record includes:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Username
   - Salary

2. **Image Slider**: The homepage contains an image slider to showcase important information visually.

### User Flow
- **Create Employee**: Users can create employee records through a form.
- **View Employees**: A list of employees is displayed, with options to filter, edit, or delete.
- **Edit/Delete Employee**: Users can modify or delete employee records directly from the list.

## Design Principles

### N-Tier Architecture
The project is structured in layers to separate concerns:
- **Core Layer**: Handles the business logic for employee management.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages data access and repositories.
- **Presentation Layer**: Built with Angular, offering a dynamic and responsive frontend.

## Frontend Development
- **Angular**: The frontend is built using Angular, with **Reactive Forms** for managing employee input and **Bootstrap** for responsive design.

## Best Practices
- **Dependency Injection**: Ensures modularity and testability.
- **RESTful API**: The backend uses a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Enhances performance in the frontend API calls.
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent and descriptive naming conventions are used throughout the codebase, improving readability and maintainability. Class names, methods, variables, and files follow standard naming rules (e.g., `PascalCase` for classes and `camelCase` for variables).
- **Code Linting**: Code linting ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to predefined coding standards by automatically flagging issues such as incorrect formatting, unused variables, and other best practice violations.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- .NET SDK 8.0 or later.
- Node.js (v14+).
- Angular CLI (v15+).
